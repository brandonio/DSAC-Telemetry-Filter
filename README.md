NASA-Telemetry-Filter
=====================

This program is used to take user inputs for start and/or end dates and a filename and filter out data packets that fit in that range and print them to documents. This is my first program and it was written as I was learning to code during my summer long internship at JPL's SpaceSHIP under NASA's MUREP. It is written in C++. Only this portion of the code was granted unlimited release by NASA. This portion of code will not function properly without the rest of it, but I still want to put my code here to document what I have written for the DSAC project.
