NASA-Telemetry-Filter
=====================

This code is used to take user inputs for start and end dates and filter out data packets that fit in that range and print them to documents. This is my first program and it was written as I was learning. It is written in C++. Only this portion of the code was granted unlimited release by NASA. The code will not function properly without the rest of it, but I still want to put my code here.
